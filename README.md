Ever wanted to share your products on your social media pages as soon as you add or edit them? Well, that’s exactly what this module does. Whenever a product is added or edited on the admin side, it is posted to your social media page. Only Facebook share is available at this version.

**Features:**

- Share to your Facebook page right away.
- Share using your own Facebook application. No link back to third party app.
- No need to log into Facebook and post the product info manually.
- Posts your product image to Facebook.
- Minimal core file edit (no core edit for OpenCart 2.x+).
